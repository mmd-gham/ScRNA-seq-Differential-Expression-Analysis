# ScRNA-seq-Differential-Expression-Analysis
In our project, we conducted a differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from breast cancer samples using the scVI model, leveraging the advanced capabilities of the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. The analysis began with the preprocessing of raw scRNA-seq data, which included quality control steps to filter out low-quality cells and normalization to account for sequencing depth variations. We then trained the scVI model on this preprocessed dataset to capture the underlying biological structures and variations present in the tumor microenvironment. This approach allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between various cell populations, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms driving breast cancer.

Furthermore, we employed clustering techniques to cluster the cells based on their expression profiles obtained from the scVI model. For each identified cluster, we successfully identified marker genes that are uniquely expressed in those specific cell populations. These marker genes serve as crucial indicators for characterizing different cell types within the breast cancer samples, providing insights into their potential roles in tumor biology and progression. 

Overall, our analysis not only highlighted key genes associated with breast cancer but also contributed to a deeper understanding of the cellular heterogeneity within tumors.
